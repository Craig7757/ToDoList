# ToDoList
I got tired of opening notepad to write things down that I needed to do
 This was made in Codeblocks using C++
 
 Since I was the intended user I ignored adding try-catch statements to verify user input types.
 There is a logic error that will crash the program if you try to delete or edit something when the list is empty;
 this can be solved by adding an aditional option at the end of the readout to cancel the current selection process.
